## Sections in the Report
Report has multiple section's from where you can manage the data, like :
- Report data can be sliced by country to show data of that particular country.
- Report has cards showing Population, Total Cases, Total Active Cases and Total Deaths.
- Report has a map section which shows the particular country selected from the slicer.
- And lastly, Report has a pie chart that shows Total Population of the Country and Total Population Recovered.
